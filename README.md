## About ☀️
Hi! I am Sunny (Hanqi) Shi, a junior at Swarthmore College majoring in statistics and minoring in computer science and philosophy. This repository contains the research and projects I have worked on. 

## [Predicting Flu Hospitalization Rates](flu_hospitalization)
### Project Overview
This project extends the ARGO (AutoRegression with Google data) methodology, originally developed to track influenza-like illness (ILI) at national, regional, and state levels. Our goal is to adapt this approach to predict weekly influenza hospitalization rates.

###  Methods
* Developed models with varying autoregressive lag times and dynamic training window lengths.
* Explored imputation techniques to address data insufficiency during COVID.
* Incorporated ILI as an exogenous predictor, using both:
  * Reported ILI from previous weeks.
  * Predicted ILI for the current week.

### Collaboration
This research was conducted with Shaoyang Ning and Kaito Hikino from Swarthmore College.

## [Circle Packing (2024)](circle_packing) 
Circle packings are fractal arrangements of mutually tangent circles with integer curvatures that have arrangements that can be described by their geometry. The Local-Global conjecture is a 20+ year old theorem that states that all integers large enough will appear for a starting configuration. In 2023, this theorem was disproven for the tetrahedral case. We determined that the Local-Global Conjecture was false in certain cases of the octahedral and cubic packings. We used a mixture of techniques mimicking the strategies used to disprove the tetrahedral case as well as data collection techniques to support our conjectures.
