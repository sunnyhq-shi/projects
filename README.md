## [Circle Packing (2024)](circle_packing) 
Circle packings are fractal arrangements of mutually tangent circles with integer curvatures that have arrangements that can be described by their geometry. The Local-Global conjecture is a 20+ year old theorem that states that all integers large enough will appear for a starting configuration. In 2023, this theorem was disproven for the tetrahedral case. We determined that the Local-Global Conjecture was false in certain cases of the octahedral and cubic packings. We used a mixture of techniques mimicking the strategies used to disprove the tetrahedral case as well as data collection techniques to support our conjectures.
