## About Me
Hi! I’m **Sunny (Hanqi) Shi**, a junior at **Swarthmore College** majoring in **Statistics** and minoring in **Computer Science** and **Philosophy**.

This repository is a collection of my research and projects, including work in :
* Statistical learning research
* Number theory research
* Personal projects that explore applications of programming and data science in my daily life

Feel free to explore — I’m always excited to share ideas and connect!

## [Predicting Flu Hospitalization Rates (2025)](flu_hospitalization)
**Project Overview**
This project extends the ARGO (AutoRegression with Google data) methodology, originally developed to track influenza-like illness (ILI) at national, regional, and state levels. Our goal is to adapt this approach to predict weekly influenza hospitalization rates.

**Methods**
* Developed models with varying autoregressive lag times and dynamic training window lengths.
* Explored imputation techniques to address data insufficiency during COVID.
* Incorporated ILI as an exogenous predictor, testing both the reported ILI from previous weeks and the predicted ILI for the current week.

**Collaboration** 
This research was conducted with Shaoyang Ning and Kaito Hikino from Swarthmore College.

## [Circle Packing (2024)](circle_packing) 
**Project Overview**
Circle packings are fractal arrangements of mutually tangent circles with integer curvatures that have arrangements that can be described by their geometry. The Local-Global Conjecture (formulated over 20 years ago) states that all sufficiently large integers should appear in certain circle packing configurations. While this was disproven for the tetrahedral case in 2023, we show that the Local-Global Conjecture is false in six additional cases of octahedral and cubic packings.

**Methods** 
* Used a mixture of techniques mimicking the strategies used to disprove the tetrahedral case.
* Collected large-scale data through computational methods to support our conjecture

**Collaboration**
This research was conducted with Ian Whitehead, Selena Shi, Hamlin Williams-Tracy, and Jeffrey Zhang from Swarthmore College and presented at the 2025 Joint Mathematics Meetings.

## Personal Projects
### [Transportation Data Science Project](others/transportation_data_project)
This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions in New York City using time-series and  methods to uncover temporal and geographic patterns in traffic fatalities and provide insights for road safety.

### [Badminton Scrimmage Scheduler](others/Badminton_Game_Lineup)
I developed a Python algorithm to help my badminton club automate scrimmage scheduling. Scrimmages typically include 24–36 games against nearby colleges. We try to schedule such that no player appears in consecutive games. Previously, this scheduling had to be done manually by one organizer, which was time-consuming. I am also developing a better interface and adding customization features — for example, accounting for players who are only available during specific time periods.
